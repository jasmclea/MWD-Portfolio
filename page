The First Piano Lessons are a series of short exercises disguised as games which combine strengthening and co-ordination with note recognition and memory. Presented in a playful and engaging way that doesn’t cause frustration, they’re perfect for introducing your child to piano at home, while bringing a lot of  fun and satisfaction along the way.

When do know if your child is ready to start learning the piano?

How can I tell if they are going to like it?

My child is only 5 – is it too early to start lessons – might it be a waste of money?

These are all frequent questions asked by parents who are interested in starting their child on the piano. There is no definitive age to start that is right for everyone. Firstly, it is vital that the child shows a desire and interest in playing the piano, and is happy to sit and concentrate for a short time, say 15 minutes to start with. It is a lot easier if they can already read a little, so it is probably best to give that a head start, and not to bombard them with too much information all at once! It also helps if they have strong little hands, although this can be improved with practise, if they do have very small hands, it might be better to let them grow a bit!

Ready to start First Piano lessons?
With this series, parents can assist their own children in the basic, first steps of playing the piano. This will lay the foundations in a fun and easy way, giving children the incentive and confidence to go on to start formal piano lessons when they are ready to do so.

And when they do start proper one-to-one lessons,  they’ll have a head start and be in a much stronger position to learn and make the most of them. Progress will be much faster, and they will be more likely to succeed and develop a real love of the instrument.
